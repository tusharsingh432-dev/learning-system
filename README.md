A teacher is supposed to add, remove, edit, and delete courses. For each course, they
will be able to create one quiz only, based on a set of questions and their respective
answers (Choice-based Questions only). Teachers should also be able to
add/edit/delete questions and answers to a quiz for a course.
A quiz can contain multiple questions, and each question may have multiple correct
answers. The teacher must set the points (positive integer with max value 10) for each
question that the student must receive by answering the question correctly.
A teacher must also specify the passing points for the overall course quiz that a student
must obtain. While taking a quiz, if a student has achieved a passing score, they can
choose to continue to earn more points or leave the quiz.
